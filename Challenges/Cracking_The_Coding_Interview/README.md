# Cracking the coding interview
## 189 Programming Question & Solutions

Here we will solve the cracking the coding interview book questions.

The focus here is to practice and learn more about this challenges and how to approach each of them.

I'll try to use more than one approach proposed in the book, but it's not a guarantee.

The idea is to check the solution only after I create my own, to gain a new perspective of how to solve the problem.

> Most of the book is focus in the Java Language, I'll write my approach in C++.
